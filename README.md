# Churn Detection with KMeans

This project implements an **unsupervised churn detection system** using KMeans clustering. It identifies user behavior patterns and flags potential churners without requiring labeled training data. The model is deployed as a REST API using FastAPI and is designed to integrate with MLOps workflows and explainability tools.

##  Features

- Unsupervised churn detection using KMeans
- End-to-end data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training, evaluation, and serialization
- Real-time inference using FastAPI
- Optional batch scoring for offline processing
- SHAP explainability for model interpretation
- Ready for deployment on GCP, AWS, or Docker
- MLOps support for automated retraining and monitoring
